Check Pod Events &amp; Details</p> <pre><code>kubectl describe pod &lt;pod-name&gt; -n &lt;namespace&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Focus on the Events section.

You are generating Kubernetes resources using <code>kompose</code>. You use the following <code>kompose</code> labels in your <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> file:</p> <ul> <li><code>kompose.volume.size</code> as <code>1Gi</code> for the requests storage\u2019s size in the PersistentVolumeClaim</li> <li><code>kompose.service.type</code> as <code>node</code> to designate the service to be created</li> <li><code>kompose.controller.type</code> as <code>daemonset</code> to convert the deployment upon creation</li> </ul> <p>When you run <code>kompose convert</code>, the command fails. Why is this?</p> <p>You must define the <code>kompose.service.type</code> as nodeport instead.</p> <p>2. How do the containers in Pods run in a Kubernetes cluster?</p> <p>A Pod has a group of one or more containers and it keeps them colocated and coscheduled on the same physical node, sharing its resources.</p> <p>3. You run a Deployment and create a Service. You confirmed that the Service exists, is reachable by Domain Name System (DNS) and IP, and has been crosschecked against the original YAML manifest. A Pod is not able to reach itself with a Service IP, however. What is the issue?</p> <p>The network is not properly configured for hairpin traffic.</p> <p>4. A static port is exposed on every worker node's network IP address passing traffic to a service. What is this an example of?</p> <p>A NodePort</p> <p>5. Why is Service an optional field in the Kubernetes web user interface (UI) deploy wizard?</p> <p>Because not every application needs to expose a Service to an external IP address</p> <p>6. You created a blue/green deployment for your Kubernetes application. After transferring all traffic to the green version, what will you do if users start to report bugs?</p> <p>Switch the traffic back to the blue version and destroy the green version.</p> <p>7. Which daemon keeps track of the kernel logs and identifies kernel vulnerabilities based on predefined rules?</p> <p>Kernel Monitor</p> <p>8. You have a simple Pod definition with two containers. One container is a sidecar and the Pod is scheduled to run once on all three worker nodes in a cluster. How many IP addresses will the Pods consume in total?</p> <p>Three IP addresses, one per Pod</p> <p>9. What does the kubectl port-forward command do?</p> <p>Forward one or more local ports to a Pod.</p> <p>10. An administrator created an application deployment from the command line. An update of the container image rescales the deployment to three instances. The admin ran the following set of commands in a Kubernetes command-line interface (CLI):  <code>kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx:1.7.9</code></p> <p><code>kubectl set image deployment/nginx nginx=nginx:1.9.1 --record=true</code></p> <p><code>kubectl scale deployment/nginx --replicas=3</code></p> <p>Because of an incident that the admin must fix in the application version, they reverse the deployment revision as follows:  <code>kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx</code></p> <p>What values will the Image and Replicas fields indicate for the deployment nginx if the admin runs the command <code>kubectl describe deployment/nginx</code>?</p> <pre><code>Image: nginx:1.7.9\nReplicas: 3\n</code></pre> <p>11. You want to create a new CronJob object called demo-job that uses the image training/demo-job and runs the /scripts/job.sh script every minute.

What is true of a blue/green deployment?</p> <p>During deployment, both the current and the new version of the application are running at the same time so that traffic can be drained from the current version and all new traffic can be sent to the new version.</p> <p>14. Which metadata field in a Pod is populated by the system?</p> <p>generation</p> <p>15. You created a Deployment with five replicas using the command <code>kubectl apply -f https://eg.com/demo/controllers/dep.yaml</code>. How can you verify if all five replicas are ready in the Deployment?</p> <p>Run <code>kubectl get deployments</code> and check if the AVAILABLE label has the number five in it.</p> <p>16. How many ways can you discover a Service in Kubernetes?  4</p> <p>17. How are files from a directory defined inside a ConfigMap?</p> <p>With the contents of a single file in the data attribute or a collection of key/value pairs that are also defined in the data attribute of the object</p> <p>18. You must implement a probe to stop Pods from receiving traffic when they are busy. The probe should also make sure the Pods are taken out within 20 seconds, checking on the /healthz:8080 endpoint.

it also requires:</p> <ul> <li>A culture that treats data as a shared, strategic asset.</li> <li>A mindset where teams prioritize data quality, governance, and reuse.</li> <li>Policies and processes that ensure data is consistent, accessible, and trusted.</li> </ul> <p>Without that cultural foundation, even the best technology won\u2019t deliver the full benefits of being data-centric.</p> <p>9 how are data products described?</p> <ul> <li>1 based on a common taxonomy and ontology</li> <li>2 based on individual preferences</li> <li>3 based on the type of data product</li> <li>4 based on stage of creation and evolution</li> </ul> <p>The correct answer is:</p> <p>1 \u2014 Based on a common taxonomy and ontology \u2705</p> <p>Data products should be described consistently so they can be easily understood, discovered, and integrated across the enterprise.</p> <ul> <li>Common taxonomy \u2192 shared classification system for organizing data products.</li> <li>Common ontology \u2192 shared definitions of terms, relationships, and meaning, ensuring everyone interprets data the same way.</li> </ul> <p>Using individual preferences (option 2) or inconsistent criteria (options 3 or 4) would lead to confusion and make data harder to reuse.</p> <p>10 what is expected of stakeholders in a system</p> <ul> <li>1 they should not make data-driven decisions</li> <li>2 they should make data-driven decisions during development</li> <li>3 they should make data-driven decisions only  during production</li> <li>4 they will make data-driven decisions to validate ideas and reduce uncertainty. These may be automated</li> </ul> <p>The correct answer is:</p> <p>4 \u2014 They will make data-driven decisions to validate ideas and reduce uncertainty. These may be automated \u2705</p> <p>In a well-designed system:</p> <ul> <li>Stakeholders rely on data to guide choices, not just intuition.</li> <li>Decisions are made throughout the lifecycle \u2014 from early validation of ideas to ongoing optimization.</li> <li>Automation can speed up decision-making and reduce human bias, especially for repetitive or real-time scenarios.</li> </ul> <p>This approach ensures that decisions are evidence-based and uncertainty is minimized.</p> <p>11 what is required for the information supplied to improve observability</p> <ul> <li>1 it must be unintelligible and unrelated</li> <li>2 it must be intelligible and unrelated</li> <li>3 it must be unintelligible and relatable</li> <li>4 it must be intelligible and relatable</li> </ul> <p>The correct answer is:</p> <p>4 \u2014 It must be intelligible and relatable \u2705</p> <p>For observability, the information you collect should:</p> <ul> <li>Be intelligible \u2192 clear, understandable, and meaningful to the people or systems consuming it.</li> <li>Be relatable \u2192 connected to the system\u2019s context, so it helps explain behaviors, issues, and performance.</li> </ul> <p>If data is unclear or irrelevant, it won\u2019t help identify problems or improve system understanding.</p> <p>12 what is expected of an enterprise regarding control plane information collection</p> <ul> <li>1 collect as little information as possible</li> <li>2 collect information only for specific use cases</li> <li>3 collect as much info as possible and use it to dynamically improve resilience, reliability, and performance</li> <li>4 collect info only for expected future use cases</li> </ul> <p>The correct answer is:</p> <p>3 \u2014 Collect as much info as possible and use it to dynamically improve resilience, reliability, and performance \u2705</p> <p>In an enterprise:</p> <ul> <li>The control plane monitors and manages systems, applications, and infrastructure.</li> <li>Collecting comprehensive information allows the enterprise to detect issues early, optimize performance, and adapt dynamically.</li> <li>Limiting data collection (options 1, 2, or 4) risks blind spots and reduces the system\u2019s ability to self-heal or improve.</li> </ul> <p>13 what is required for backing service</p> <ul> <li>1 they cannot be exchanged during other operation</li> <li>2 they can only be exchanged during deployment</li> <li>3 they can be exchanged during operation without redeploying the application</li> <li>4 they cannot be exchanged at all</li> </ul> <p>The correct answer is:</p> <p>3 \u2014 They can be exchanged during operation without redeploying the application \u2705</p> <p>A backing service (like databases, message queues, or caches) should be:</p> <ul> <li>Replaceable at runtime without requiring changes or redeployment of the application.</li> <li>This allows for flexibility, scaling, and resilience, letting the system swap services if needed (e.g., for upgrades, failover, or switching vendors).</li> </ul> <p>Options 1, 2, and 4 would limit operational flexibility and violate the principles of modern, cloud-native design.</p> <p>14 what is the requirement for services specific to an application?</p> <ul> <li>1 they should be deployed and enabled as part of deploying an application</li> <li>2 they should not be part of deploying an application</li> <li>3 they should be specific to each environment</li> <li>4 they should not be enabled during deployment</li> </ul> <p>The correct answer is:</p> <p>1 \u2014 They should be deployed and enabled as part of deploying an application \u2705</p> <p>Services that are specific to an application (like certain APIs, caches, or supporting microservices) must:</p> <ul> <li>Be deployed together with the application to ensure it functions correctly.</li> <li>Be enabled automatically during deployment to avoid manual configuration errors.</li> </ul> <p>Options 2, 3, and 4 would risk the application failing to run properly or inconsistencies across environments.</p> <p>15 which of following is true about a codebase</p> <ul> <li>1 it can be forked for different deployment</li> <li>2 different deployment may have different codebase</li> <li>3 it must be singular even it different have configuration that apply to them</li> <li>4 env specific code be included in the codebase</li> </ul> <p>3 \u2014 It must be singular even if different deployments have configurations that apply to them \u2705</p> <p>In modern development practices:</p> <ul> <li>A single codebase is maintained for all deployments to ensure consistency, easier maintenance, and streamlined updates.</li> <li>Deployment-specific variations (like environment settings, feature flags, or secrets) are handled through configuration, not by duplicating or forking the code.</li> </ul> <p>Options 1, 2, and 4 go against best practices because forking or including environment-specific code leads to complexity, drift, and maintenance challenges.</p> <p>16 what is the importance of maintaining links in a codebase</p> <ul> <li>1 it allows for forking of the codebase</li> <li>2 it ensures that different deployment have different codebases</li> <li>3 it defines the codebase and ensures it remains singular</li> <li>4 it allows for env specific code to be included in the codebase</li> </ul> <p>The correct answer is:</p> <p>3 \u2014 It defines the codebase and ensures it remains singular \u2705</p> <p>Maintaining links (like references to modules, libraries, or dependencies) is important because:</p> <ul> <li>It keeps the codebase coherent and unified.</li> <li>Ensures all deployments use the same underlying code while allowing configuration to handle environment-specific differences.</li> <li>Prevents fragmentation or duplication that can lead to maintenance challenges and inconsistencies.</li> </ul> <p>Options 1, 2, and 4 would undermine the principle of a single, maintainable codebase.</p> <p>17 what does the enterprise do with collected information</p> <ul> <li>1 it use to maintain it's current security posture</li> <li>2 it use to improve its security  posture dynamically</li> <li>3 it uses it to improve  its security  posture statically</li> </ul> <p>The correct answer is:</p> <p>2 \u2014 It uses it to improve its security posture dynamically \u2705</p> <p>In a modern enterprise:</p> <ul> <li>Collected information (logs, metrics, alerts, access patterns) is continuously analyzed.</li> <li>This allows the enterprise to adapt and enhance security in real time, responding to threats, vulnerabilities, or anomalous behavior.</li> <li>Static approaches (option 3) or using data only for maintenance (option 1) are insufficient in dynamic, evolving environments.</li> </ul> <p>18 how is access to individual enterprise resources granted</p> <ul> <li>1 on a atomic basis</li> <li>2 on a large basis</li> <li>3 on a case-by-case basis</li> <li>4 on a device-by-device basis</li> </ul> <p>The correct answer is:</p> <p>1 \u2014 On an atomic basis \u2705</p> <p>In a data-centric enterprise, access control is fine-grained:</p> <ul> <li>Permissions are granted at the smallest logical unit of a resource (atomic level), such as a specific record, file, or service operation.</li> <li>This ensures least-privilege access, improving security and reducing the risk of unauthorized use.</li> </ul> <p>Options 2, 3, and 4 are less precise and do not provide the same level of control and protection.</p> <p>19 what is an attribute of an independent service</p> <ul> <li>1 being stateful</li> <li>2 being able to share state with other services</li> <li>3 being able to predict its halting externally</li> <li>4 being stateless</li> </ul> <p>The correct answer is:</p> <p>4 \u2014 Being stateless \u2705</p> <p>An independent service in modern architectures (like microservices) is typically:</p> <ul> <li>Stateless, meaning it does not retain client-specific data between requests.</li> <li>This enables scalability, resilience, and easier deployment, because any instance of the service can handle any request.</li> </ul> <p>Options 1 and 2 (stateful or sharing state) reduce independence, and option 3 (predicting halting externally) is not a defining attribute of independence.</p> <p>20 what is required for publishing events</p> <ul> <li>1 must have a defined schema and be published using registered topic</li> <li>2 must have a defined schema and published using unregistered topic</li> <li>3 they do not have defined schema</li> <li>4 they can be published without using topic</li> </ul> <p>The correct answer is:</p> <p>1 \u2014 Must have a defined schema and be published using a registered topic \u2705</p> <p>For event-driven systems:</p> <ul> <li>A defined schema ensures that consumers understand the structure and meaning of the event data.</li> <li>Using a registered topic ensures discoverability, governance, and proper routing of events across the system.</li> </ul> <p>Options 2, 3, and 4 would lead to ambiguity, integration issues, and potential system errors.</p> <p>21 what must be clear when cloud services scale with demand</p> <ul> <li>1 the cost of scaling </li> <li>2 the root cause of the demand</li> <li>3 the number of users</li> <li>4 the type of service</li> </ul> <p>The correct answer is:</p> <p>1 \u2014 The cost of scaling \u2705</p> <p>When cloud services scale dynamically with demand, it\u2019s essential to understand how much it will cost to handle increased load.</p> <ul> <li>This allows the organization to budget appropriately and avoid unexpected expenses.</li> <li>While understanding the number of users, root cause of demand, and type of service can be useful, the primary concern for scaling decisions is the financial impact.</li> </ul> <p>22 how are cloud services charged</p> <ul> <li>1 to the users of the service</li> <li>2 to the developer of service</li> <li>3 to the owner of service</li> <li>4 to the admin  of service</li> </ul> <p>The correct answer is:</p> <p>3 \u2014 To the owner of the service \u2705</p> <p>In cloud computing:</p> <ul> <li>The service owner is responsible for costs associated with running the service, including compute, storage, networking, and any managed services used.</li> <li>Users of the service typically consume the service but do not directly pay the underlying cloud provider unless a billing model is set up.</li> <li>Developers or admins may influence costs but are not typically charged directly.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Eng/1work/","title":"1

How many stages are there in DevOps?</p> <p>The DevOps lifecycle has eight phases:</p> <ul> <li>Planning: A detailed application type plan is required to fully understand the development process.</li> <li>Code: The program is coded according to the requirements of the end user.</li> <li>Build: Create the application by merging the code generated by the previous stages.</li> <li>Testing: This is the most important stage in the application creation process. Check the functionality of the application and rewrite it if something goes wrong.</li> <li>Integration: Multiple codes from different programmers are combined into one code.</li> <li>Deployment: Publishing code in the cloud for use by other users. New updates are thoroughly checked to make sure they don't break high-traffic sites.</li> <li>Action: Manipulate the code if necessary.</li> <li>Monitoring: The running of the application is always monitored. The needs of the final consumer are prioritized and adjusted accordingly.</li> </ul> <p>DevOps \u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6709\u516b\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a</p> <ul> <li>\u8ba1\u5212\uff1a\u9700\u8981\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7c7b\u578b\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5168\u9762\u4e86\u89e3\u5f00\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002</li> <li>\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6839\u636e\u6700\u7ec8\u7528\u6237\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u7801\u3002</li> <li>\u6784\u5efa\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u5e76\u524d\u9762\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6765\u521b\u5efa\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002</li> <li>\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1a\u8fd9\u662f\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u521b\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u68c0\u67e5\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u51fa\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u5219\u91cd\u5199\u5b83\u3002</li> <li>\u96c6\u6210\uff1a\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u88ab\u7ec4\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u3002</li> <li>\u90e8\u7f72\uff1a\u5728\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u53d1\u5e03\u4ee3\u7801\u4f9b\u5176\u4ed6\u7528\u6237\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u65b0\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u90fd\u4f1a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5f7b\u5e95\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0d\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u9ad8\u6d41\u91cf\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\u3002</li> <li>\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1a\u5982\u679c\u9700\u8981\uff0c\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002</li> <li>\u76d1\u63a7\uff1a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u59cb\u7ec8\u53d7\u5230\u76d1\u63a7\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u88ab\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\uff0c\u5e76\u505a\u51fa\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u3002</li> </ul> <p>5.

You can later use VCS to merge all the changes into one release.</li> <li>VCS neatly organizes all previous iterations and variants. You can request any version whenever you need it, giving you instant access to screenshots of your entire project.</li> <li>Every time you save an updated version of your project, your VCS asks you to enter a short summary of the changes you made. Additionally, you can view the contents of the file to determine what changes have been made. From this you can determine who changed the content of the project.</li> <li>If the central server goes down, you can use any team member's local Git repository because a distributed VCS like Git gives all team members access to the entire project history.</li> </ul> <p>\u6211\u5efa\u8bae\u60a8\u5217\u51fa\u7248\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u597d\u5904\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a</p> <ul> <li>\u7248\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf(VCS)\u4f7f\u6240\u6709\u56e2\u961f\u6210\u5458\u80fd\u591f\u968f\u65f6\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6587\u4ef6 \u3002\u60a8\u7a0d\u540e\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528 VCS \u5c06\u6240\u6709\u66f4\u6539\u5408\u5e76\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u4e2d\u3002</li> <li>VCS \u6574\u9f50\u5730\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u6240\u6709\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u53d8\u4f53\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u968f\u65f6\u7d22\u53d6\u4efb\u4f55\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7acb\u5373\u8bbf\u95ee\u6574\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5c4f\u5e55\u622a\u56fe\u3002</li> <li>\u6bcf\u6b21\u4fdd\u5b58\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u7248\u672c\u65f6\uff0c\u60a8\u7684 VCS \u90fd\u8981\u6c42\u60a8\u8f93\u5165\u6240\u505a\u66f4\u6539\u7684\u7b80\u77ed\u6458\u8981\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u67e5\u770b\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u54ea\u4e9b\u66f4\u6539\u3002\u7531\u6b64\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u8c01\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002</li> <li>\u5982\u679c\u4e2d\u592e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u51fa\u73b0\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u4f55\u56e2\u961f\u6210\u5458\u7684\u672c\u5730 Git \u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u50cf Git \u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f VCS \u4f7f\u6240\u6709\u56e2\u961f\u6210\u5458\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbf\u95ee\u6574\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002</li> </ul> <p>11.

How does Ansible work?</p> <p>There are two different categories of servers in Ansible:</p> <ul> <li>Control the machine</li> <li>node</li> </ul> <p>Ansible must be installed on the control computer to manage nodes using SSH.

What is Continuous Testing (CT)?</p> <p>Continuous testing (CT) is a DevOps phase that requires running automated test cases, which are components of an automated software delivery pipeline. This is a way to receive immediate feedback on the performance of the code being developed and the validation of any business risks.</p> <p>CT is the DevOps step that consists of executing automated test cases as part of the pipeline in order to receive quick feedback on the quality and validation of company risks associated with automatically generated code.</p> <p>By using this stage, the team will be able to continuously test each build (once the developed code is pushed), giving the development team the opportunity to receive immediate feedback on their work, and preventing these issues from recurring later in the SDLC.</p> <p>Doing so will significantly speed up a developer's workflow for developing a project by eliminating the manual involvement steps required to rebuild the project and execute automated tests every time a change occurs.</p> <p>\u6301\u7eed\u6d4b\u8bd5 (CT) \u662f\u9700\u8981\u8fd0\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u7684 DevOps \u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u662f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ea4\u4ed8\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u63a5\u6536\u6709\u5173\u6240\u5f00\u53d1\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4efb\u4f55\u4e1a\u52a1\u98ce\u9669\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5373\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002</p> <p>CT \u662f DevOps \u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u6267\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u63a5\u6536\u6709\u5173\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53cd\u9988\u3002</p> <p>\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u6b64\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u56e2\u961f\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u8fde\u7eed\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6784\u5efa\uff08\u4e00\u65e6\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u88ab\u63a8\u9001\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f00\u53d1\u56e2\u961f\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u6536\u5230\u6709\u5173\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u5373\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u7a0d\u540e\u5728 SDLC \u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u5faa\u73af\u3002</p> <p>\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u53d1\u751f\u66f4\u6539\u65f6\u91cd\u5efa\u9879\u76ee\u548c\u6267\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6240\u9700\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u53c2\u4e0e\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\u5c06\u663e\u7740\u52a0\u5feb\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u5f00\u53d1\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002</p> <p>17.

Describe IaC and configuration management</p> <p>Unlike manually or through a GUI, the infrastructure as code (IaC) paradigm manages and tracks infrastructure configuration in files. This allows for more flexibility in the configuration of the infrastructure, and more importantly, changes can be clearly tracked using a version control system.</p> <p>Software programs known as configuration management systems enable consistent, reliable, and secure management of environments. By using an optimized DSL to specify the state and configuration of system elements, multiple people can collaborate and store system configurations for hundreds of servers in one place.</p> <p>Ansible has no centralized server, configuration is stored in YAML. Via SSH (or WinRM on Windows), the stateful configuration is sent to the server, where it is then executed. The downside of this approach is that managing thousands of machines can take a long time.</p>

However, this doesn't work that well because if the port is closed, it takes bash like 2 minutes to realize that.</p> <p>To solve this I needed something like <code>alarm(2)</code> system call to interrupt bash. </p> <p>Bash doesn't have a built-in alarm function, so I had to write a helper program in Perl to handle SIGALRM.</p> <pre><code>alarm() {\n  perl -e '\n    eval {\n      $SIG{ALRM} = sub { die };\n      alarm shift;\n      system(@ARGV);\n    };\n    if ($@) { exit 1 }\n  ' \"$@\";\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This alarm function takes two args \u2013 seconds for the alarm call and the code to execute. If the code doesn't execute in the given time, the function fails.</p> <p>Once I had this, I could take my earlier code and just call it through alarm:</p> <pre><code>for port in {1..65535}; do\n  alarm 1 \"echo &gt;/dev/tcp/google.com/$port\" &amp;&amp;\n    echo \"port $port is open\" ||\n    echo \"port $port is closed\"\ndone\n</code></pre> <p>This is working! Now if bash freezes because of a closed port, alarm 1 will kill the probe in 1 second and the script will move to the next port.</p> <p>I went ahead and turned this into a proper scan function:</p> <pre><code>scan() {\n  if [[ -z $1 || -z $2 ]]; then\n    echo \"Usage: $0 &lt;host&gt; &lt;port, ports, or port-range&gt;\"\n    return\n  fi\n\n  local host=$1\n  local ports=()\n  case $2 in\n    *-*)\n      IFS=- read start end &lt;&lt;&lt; \"$2\"\n      for ((port=start; port &lt;= end; port++)); do\n        ports+=($port)\n      done\n      ;;\n    *,*)\n      IFS=, read -ra ports &lt;&lt;&lt; \"$2\"\n      ;;\n    *)\n      ports+=($2)\n      ;;\n  esac\n\n  for port in \"${ports[@]}\"; do\n    alarm 1 \"echo &gt;/dev/tcp/$host/$port\" &amp;&amp;\n      echo \"port $port is open\" ||\n      echo \"port $port is closed\"\n  done\n}\n</code></pre> <p>ou can run the scan function from your shell. It takes two arguments \u2013 the host to scan and a list of ports to scan (such as 22,80,443), or a range of ports to scan (such as 1-1024), or an individual port to scan (such as 80).</p> <p>Here is what happens when I run scan google.com 78-82.</p> <pre><code>$ scan google.com 78-82 \nport 78 is closed\nport 79 is closed\nport 80 is open\nport 81 is closed\nport 82 is closed\n</code></pre> <p>Similarly you can write an udp port scanner. Just replace /dev/tcp/ with /dev/udp/.</p>"},{"location":"chap8/35port_detect/#timeout","title":"timeout","text":"<pre><code>$ timeout 1 bash -c \"echo &gt;/dev/tcp/$host/$port\" &amp;&amp;\n    echo
